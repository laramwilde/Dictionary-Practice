# Dictionary Practice Project

A small Python project to help me learn and practise **dictionaries**, including:
- adding contacts
- searching for contacts
- updating contact info
- deleting contacts
- viewing all stored contacts

## Features
- Menu system
- User input handling
- Data stored in nested dictionaries

## Why I made this
I'm learning Python and dictionaries are my weakest topic, so this project should help me build confidence 😛 
Chat GPT made this project for me.
